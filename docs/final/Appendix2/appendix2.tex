\chapter{Risk Assessment Retrospective}
\label{sec:appendix2}

The risk assessment submitted at the outset of this project identified only hazard - relating to extended use of a computer. As this project is mostly a computational project, this was the most frequently occurring hazard through the duration of the project. Most of the experiments used artificial, computer generated datasets, and the real world datasets that were used were collected by other individuals, therefore there was no hazard in collecting the datasets. The only other possible risk is a very small electrical and mechanical risk involved in the mechanical testing section.
